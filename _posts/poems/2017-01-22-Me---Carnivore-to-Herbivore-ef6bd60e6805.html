You must be wondering what is “Born Vegetarian”.<br>May be you have already guessed by now. Indians are diverse in many aspects, one being casteism. So I am a Brahmin, which makes me a vegetarian by birth. As brahmins, we should abstain from non vegetarian diet. <br>Oh Wait ! There are exceptions too. A pahadi brahmin(brahmin who belongs to hills)has the liberty to break this rule. I don’t just say this, but I know many people who believe this. The reason is so obvious, its so freaking cold….. in the hills?</p><p name="e1b9" id="e1b9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Huh!! All this looked like bullshit to me. Everybody had some or the other reasons to break the rule. Brahim just seems like a medal to many people, they won in the Olympics. The same people would stealthily have a super supper non-veg meal in the night. And in the morning throw the evidences(left-overs) in the garbage bags. Yes thats what so many people do.</p><figure name="1a1d" id="1a1d" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 480px; max-height: 270px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 56.3%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*aAb3jj5xwfKeiuQCyPySTQ.gif" data-width="480" data-height="270" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*aAb3jj5xwfKeiuQCyPySTQ.gif"></div></figure><p name="c85d" id="c85d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">I have never liked such hypocrisies. I don’t claim to be unique. But I have never believed in something just for the sake of it. I just can’t fake something because I might be tagged non-religious. I can’t be a vegetarian because, I was born brahmin. Or out of fear, that may be GOD would punish me if I don’t follow the pre-set rules, or may be the society would see me with disdain.</p><p name="9324" id="9324" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As a child I used to have non-veg, because I loved its taste. Belonging to a Brahmin family, getting to eat non-veg during my childhood days was very rare. It was more during my engineering days that I could satisfy my cravings for non-vegetarian food. I not only liked it, I rather loved it.</p><p name="07e5" id="07e5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">After 2–3 years of non-vegetarian years, I suddenly started going through severe health issues. My doctor advised me to stop eating non-vegetarian food, and few other things. I then realized I was not made for it. And decided to quit. Days passed by. I did sniff at my friends non-vegetarian dish, but not eat…trying to resists the temptation. :p<br>One fine day, I was dying of hunger. My eyes got stuck on a KFC outlet and heart started pounding. I went inside drooling like a dog. Ordered a bucket and there I was back to square one. Back then I was so in love with KFC chicken bucket, that I just couldn’t put a break.</p><figure name="4372" id="4372" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 625px; max-height: 468px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 74.9%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*NfYkucgV2gEAH7w7IhDZ7w.gif" data-width="625" data-height="468" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*NfYkucgV2gEAH7w7IhDZ7w.gif"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">Me at KFC</figcaption></figure><p name="98cf" id="98cf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Few days later, came the life changing day of my life.

If my love for animals is so pure, then why did I need a video to show me the light.<br>I will be very frank to all of you, I really don’t know WHY…. :(<br>I had never thought about the harm I am causing to these innocent creatures. I am thankful to Madhavan and everyone involved in such initiatives who are an eye-opener for people like me.</p><p name="0572" id="0572" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Through this article I do want to repent all that I did for so many years.<br>Its definitely not about Karma here.
