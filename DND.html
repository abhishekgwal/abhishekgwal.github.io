<p>
  Do Not Disturb is an iOS application, built on top of the the native DND feature provided provided by iOS. The app extends the basic DND functionality to give the user flexbility and ease of exploiting DND at its best. 
  One can activate from numerous custom profiles with one tap anytime and let the app do the rest i.e. silence calls from contacts which are not allowed as per the profile.
</p>
<p> 
  The app can also be configured to tag a location to a profile. This geotagging feature then activates a DND profile according to the location.
  Here is list of basic features the app provides-
